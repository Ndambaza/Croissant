    <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Natalie ðŸ’• Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Iâ€™m based
      in the UK and I love exploring creativity in all its formsâ€”whether thatâ€™s
      coding, writing, or finding new ways to bring ideas to life. Lately, Iâ€™ve
      been diving into front-end development and really enjoying how I can mix
      design with technology to build things that feel fun and interactive (like
      my Love Poem Generator âœ¨). Outside of coding, I like keeping life
      balanced with yoga and fitness, and Iâ€™m always experimenting with healthy
      high-protein recipes. I also have a soft spot for poetry, languages, and
      self-growthâ€”right now Iâ€™m learning Korean so I can use it in everyday
      conversations. This site is a reflection of me: a mix of tech, creativity,
      and personal passions. Thanks for stopping byâ€”I hope you enjoy exploring
      it as much as Iâ€™ve enjoyed creating it! ðŸŒ¸
